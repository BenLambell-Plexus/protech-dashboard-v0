Protech dashboard hosted via Git Pages.

To test locally, run in a Python webserver using `python3 -m http.server` (some iframes may not function correctly if the webpage is accessed via the filesystem).

Note uBlock origin and similar extensions may cause problems loading NewRelic charts in iframes, and should be disabled.

Can permanently cast to a ChromeCast device using https://stestagg.github.io/dashcast/.
